This is a repository for data and code I have developed in collaboration with colleagues at the Union of Concerned Scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The novel data set covid_tests_data_UCS.csv includes county-level data for over 900 counties in the United States. The data include the total number of COVID-19 tests administered by county and the share that had a positive result. Also included are metrics from the Center for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index. Data were collected from statistics reported by states listed in the covid_tests_data_sources_UCS.xlsx file. These data were analyzed and described in a blog post. The data represent a snapshot from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US through April 10, 2020. 

If you would like more information on the data or its use, please contact me at kdahl@ucsusa.org.
